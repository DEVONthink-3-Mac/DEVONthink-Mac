## üß© Overview  

DEVONthink 3 for macOS is a comprehensive digital brain designed for professionals, researchers, and creators who need a reliable way to capture, organize, and retrieve large volumes of information. Whether you‚Äôre managing academic papers, business notes, or creative research, it provides the perfect balance between structure and intelligence.  

At its core, DEVONthink is a powerful database system capable of storing all types of content ‚Äî documents, PDFs, bookmarks, images, emails, and even complete websites. What sets it apart is its AI engine, which analyzes your stored materials, automatically classifies files into relevant groups, and suggests connections between related topics.

For automation, DEVONthink offers AppleScript, Automator, and Shortcuts support, giving you the ability to tailor the app to your personal workflow.  

Syncing across devices is secure and flexible. Using iCloud, Dropbox, or WebDAV, you can synchronize databases between your Mac, iPhone, and iPad while keeping everything encrypted and private. This makes DEVONthink ideal for anyone working across multiple environments or collaborating remotely.  

Optimized for Apple Silicon, DEVONthink 3 runs with impressive speed and efficiency, handling thousands of files effortlessly. It‚Äôs more than a simple file organizer ‚Äî it‚Äôs a central knowledge system that learns how you work, helping you think, write, and create more effectively.
